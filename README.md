## About me
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a developer always looking to improve and expand my knowledge in the field of technology. 
I am passionate about learning new tools and learning both frontend and backend. 
Since I was a kid, I have always had a penchant for creativity and the idea of helping others create solutions. 
Programming excites me because it allows me to have a positive impact on people, 
and I always look for every project I work on to learn and have fun in the process.
